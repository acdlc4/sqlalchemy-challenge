# sqlalchemy-challenge

The purpose of this coding challenge is to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration of the provided climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  

This analysis is in preparation for a proposed long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii in order to help with trip planning.

Depending on one's preference for rain, the jupyter notebook analysis provides a means of figuring out which time of year has the highest risk of heavier rainfall as shown in the following visualization:

Additionally, the jupyter notebook helps us figure out the location that is the most-active reporting location, which is USC00519281 - Waihee, HI.  The following histogram, based on this most-active location, shows us the high temperature measures and how often high temperatures reach the most favored temperatures above 70Â°F, at least by this coder's personal choice.

Here's to hoping this helps in your (and also my) next trip to Hawaii!!
