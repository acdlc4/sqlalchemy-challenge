The purpose of this coding challenge is to perform basic climate analysis and data exploration of the provided climate database using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.  

This analysis is in preparation for a proposed long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii in order to help with trip planning.
